# simon_game

This is a Simon game created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It generates a random sequence of colors and plays a corresponding sound for each one. The user has to repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons. If the user matches the sequence correctly, the level increases by one and a new color is added to the sequence. If the user makes a mistake, the game ends and resets the level.
